# Linux Imaginary 0.5.x (Sachiel)

### THE ISO IS TOO BIG FOR GITHUB, PLEASE GO TO : <https://dumbestgirla.live/linuximaginary/current/linuximaginary-0.5.6_x86-64.iso>

<br/>
This is my custom arch based distro called Linux Imaginary, its still in development. This is version 0.5.X (Sachiel). This live iso comes with nmtui for easy access to the internet, as well as vim for any potential modification that must be made.
The real nice part about this puppy right here is the auto installer. All in CLI, you choose your user, your passwd, hostname, disk to format, you choose your DE / WM and it does all the rest of the job itself!

<br/>
<br/>
Neofetch is repackaged and pre installed in every install, repackaged for that sweet sweet custom ascii. More repackaged programs will be added if you ask for it.
<br/>

<br/>
This project was mainly to help myself learn better bash and the backend of how linux works. I have installed arch manually many times but, and I have done LFS, but I wanted to test out if I could make an automatic install script for my own distro. The installer does borrow parts from ArchTitus due to it being used as my primary inspiration for this installer, so thank you to Chris Titus in a way I dont expect this OS to gain any traction, its pretty much just a fun project for me also an auto installer cause i reinstall linux so much, so if anyone actually uses this, thank you

<br/>
<br/>

### System info binaries other than neofetch are currently not natively supporting the distro ascii, however the file for the ascii can be found in your root directory post install

## current version message


>
>BSPWM auto install currently does NOT work, at least it doesnt when I try on my VM
>
>
>I am trying to find a way to also repackage hyfetch at this moment. Hyfetch locks people from repackaging it to stop right wing trolls from adding offensive flags, which >i understand, but it also means that until i can find a way to repackage it with the current distro ascii, an alias needs to be made in my bash/zsh config.
>
>Currently also trying to optimize it. 0.5.6 is the first public build as some of my friends and classmates wanted to try the OS for themselves, but the OS is nowhere near complete, its still too close to arch for me to truly call it my own, in either way its here and god knows its queer
